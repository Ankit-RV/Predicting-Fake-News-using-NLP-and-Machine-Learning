# Predicting-Fake-News-using-NLP-and-Machine-Learning
A simple guide to applying traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques using Python on Fake News Dataset. 

* Developed a machine learning model to predict fake news using NLP techniques, achieving an accuracy of X% on the test dataset.

* Preprocessed the text data by expanding contractions, converting to lower-case, tokenizing, and removing stop words using regex and NLTK.

* Conducted text analysis to identify frequent words in both genuine and fake news articles using word clouds, revealing patterns of language use in each category.

* Employed stylometric analysis to investigate features such as the number of sentences per article, average words per sentence, average word length, and POS tag counts, highlighting differences between genuine and fake news articles.

* Utilized both Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF techniques to transform the text data into numerical features, and benchmarked several machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boost, and Ada Boost classifiers to identify the best-performing model.

* Developed effective data visualization techniques to display the results of text and stylometric analyses, improving the overall presentation of findings.


* Improved data cleaning processes by identifying and addressing issues such as null values in the text articles, titles, and author columns, ultimately enhancing the accuracy of the machine learning model.
